# About
This page lists all of the commands and permissions that are available with TAB. Commands have required permissions associated with them.

**BungeeCord / Velocity users:**
* If you have TAB installed **on the proxy**, use **/btab** instead of /tab. Permissions are the same.
* Permission nodes are checked on the server where the plugin is installed (by default). This means that with TAB on BungeeCord, permission nodes are checked on BungeeCord and therefore you'll need a permission plugin there as well. If you wish to take permission groups and checks from backend servers instead, set `use-bukkit-permissions-manager: true` in config.

# Other
## /tab cpu
* **Permission:** `tab.cpu`
* **Description:** Shows approximate CPU usage of the plugin from the last 10 seconds. There are parts which are impossible to be measured, so this shows slighty less than the real value is. The content is self-explanatory. All ways to decrease CPU usage can be found at [Optimizing the plugin](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Optimizing-the-plugin).

## /tab parse \<player\> \<text\>
* **Permission:** `tab.parse`

# Additional permissions
* `tab.admin` - Allows the player to execute all commands.
* `tab.bypass` - If per-world player list is enabled as well as this permission, it allows the player to see everyone on the server, regardless of what the per-world player list settings allow. For example, if your per-world player list is set up to isolate worlds A and B, players with this permission will see all players from both A and B on their player list, whereas players that don't will only see either players from world A or players from world B, depending on what world they are in.
* `tab.staff` - Allows the player to be counted in the `%staffonline%` placeholder.
* `tab.spectatorbypass` - If enabling bypass permission in [Spectator fix](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Spectator-fix), this is the permission.
* `tab.tabcomplete` - Allows the player to auto-complete the `/tab` command.
* `tab.seevanished` - Allows the player to see other vanished players on the [Global Playerlist](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Global-playerlist) and marks the player as able to see vanished players when using [Aligned suffix](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Aligned-Tabsuffix) feature to properly space out suffixes of players based on what the player can and cannot see.
