# About
Nametags are controlled by a feature called scoreboard teams. They offer 6 properties:
* Team name - used for sorting players in tablist, see [Sorting guide](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Sorting-players-in-tablist) for more info
* Prefix - prefix displayed in nametag, it will be referred to as `tagprefix`
* Suffix - suffix displayed in nametag, it will be referred to as `tagsuffix`
* Nametag visibility rule
* Collision rule
* Team color (1.13+) - used to set name and glow color (check out [How to make TAB compatible with glow plugins](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/How-to-make-TAB-compatible-with-glow-plugins)) (on 1.12- it uses last color of prefix).

When enabling this feature, TAB will control all of these. It is not possible to take values from 2 different teams (plugins). Most of the compatibility problems with other plugins can be solved with placeholders. If you want sorting but not nametags, just don't configure any prefix/suffix. If you want another plugin to handle teams, configure sorting in that plugin.

This feature can be configured in **config.yml** under **scoreboard-teams** section.

# Configuration
## Groups and users
Properties can be applied in 2 ways: groups and users. Users can be defined by both username and their UUID. Values applied to users take priority over groups.

**groups.yml**
```
admin:
  tagprefix: "&4&lAdmin &r"
```

This can also be achieved with commands, in this case `/tab group admin tagprefix "&4&lAdmin &r"`.

**users.yml**
```
_NEZNAMY_:
  tagprefix: "&6&lTAB &r"

# An alternate way using UUID
237d8b55-3f97-4749-aa60-e9fe97b45062:
  tagprefix: "&6&lTAB &r"
```
This can also be achieved with commands, in this case `/tab player _NEZNAMY_ tagprefix "&4&lAdmin &r"` or `/tab playeruuid _NEZNAMY_ tagprefix "&4&lAdmin &r"`.

Properties can also be set as "default" for everyone who does not have them defined. For that purpose, a group keyword `_DEFAULT_` was made.  
**groups.yml**
```
admin:
  tagprefix: "&4&lAdmin &r"
_DEFAULT_:
  tagprefix: "&7" # This will be displayed on everyone except admin
```

## Per-world / per-server
Values can also be applied per-world (and per-server on bungeecord), where they can be defined per group/user. These values take priority over global settings. Example:  
**groups.yml**
```
per-world:
  world1:
    _DEFAULT_:
      tagprefix: "&a" # Everyone in world "world1" will have this prefix
per-server:
  server1:
    _DEFAULT_:
      tagprefix: "&a" # Everyone in server "server1" will have this prefix
```

For multiple worlds/servers to share the same settings, separate them with a`;`.  
For worlds/server starting with a specified text, use `*` after shared part. For ending with a shared part, use `*` at the beginning.  
Example:
```
per-world:
  world1;world2:
    _DEFAULT_:
      tagsuffix: "Shared tagsuffix in worlds world1 and world2"
  lobby-*:
    _DEFAULT_:
      tagsuffix: "Suffix in all worlds starting with lobby-"
```

## Priority system
Full list of priorities looks like this:
1. value set using the [API](#api)
2. per-world / per-server applied to username
3. value applied to username
4. per-world / per-server applied to uuid
5. value applied to uuid
6. per-world / per-server applied to player's group
7. per-world / per-server applied to group `_DEFAULT_`
8. value applied to player's group
9. value applied to group `_DEFAULT_`

This list is browsed through until the first match is found. If no match is found, empty value is used.

Values are taken independently from each other. This means you can set per-world tagprefix, but only keep one global tagsuffix for example.

You can see source of a value displayed on player by using `/tab debug <player>` and checking "source" part of the value you are looking for.

## Placeholder support
All values fully support [TAB's internal placeholders](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Placeholders#internal-placeholders) and [PlaceholderAPI placeholders](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders) including relational placeholders. Amount of placeholders is not limited and they can be used in combination with static text as well.

## Additional settings
| Option name | Default value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| enabled | true | Enables / Disables the feature |
| enable-collision | true | Controls collision rule. Available values are: <br />- `true` - Collision will be enabled permanently. <br />- `false` - Collision will be disabled permanently. <br /> - *Conditional expression* - Collision will be enabled if player meets the condition (for example `%world%=world` will result in collision only being enabled for players in world `world`). <br /> - *Condition name* - Uses name of a [defined condition](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Conditional-placeholders) that must be met for a player to have collision enabled. |
| invisible-nametags | false| When enabled, everyone will have invisible nametag all the time. Option to hide nametags was added in minecraft **1.8**, therefore it will not work on 1.7 and lower. |
| anti-override | true | While enabled, prevents other plugins from assigning online players into teams and making TAB not work correctly. They should be configured to not use teams, however many users fail to disable features in other plugins that they don't want, making this option required. Some plugins don't even say they use teams to achieve their goals. Did you know even Paper uses teams? |
| can-see-friendly-invisibles | false | Controlling value of the team flag. It allows you to see invisible players in the same team as transparent instead of completely invisible. Since TAB places each player into an individual team, this option will only take effect in combination with plugins that spawn a dummy clone of the player (sit or disguise plugins). |
| disable-condition | %world%=disabledworld | A [condition](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Conditional-placeholders) that must be met for disabling the feature for players. Set to empty for not disabling the feature ever. |

# Tips & Tricks
If you want TAB to only take prefixes/suffixes from permission plugin, delete all groups from **grous.yml** and only keep this:
```
_DEFAULT_:
  tagprefix: "%luckperms-prefix%"
  tagsuffix: "%luckperms-suffix%"
```

# Limitations
* Prefix/suffix length is limited to 16 characters (including color codes) on <1.13. There is no reachable limit on 1.13+.
* Name cannot be effectively changed and plugin doesn't offer it.
* Since 1.13, the name can only have one code. That is either color or magic code (such as &4 or &l), but not both.
* Name does not support RGB codes. Any used RGB colors will be rounded to the nearest legacy code.
* Name color and glow color are managed by the same value, which means they cannot be different.

# Additional info
## Additional note 1 - NPC (in)compatibility
Teams are bound to player names, not uuids or entity ids. Because of that, they will affect all player entities with that name. This includes NPCs with same names as online players and prefixes/suffixes will be displayed on those as well. To avoid it, make their names not match any online player and use holograms to display them instead (Citizens has an option for this).

## Additional note 2 - Prefix/suffix on pets
Since 1.9 teams affect tamed animals as well, displaying prefix/suffix on them as well and if nametags are set to be invisible, they will be completely invisible as well. If you want to avoid it, install [this plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/109466/).

## Additional note 3 - Changing name itself
Teams do not allow to change the nametag name itself. Changing name is a complicated process which is slightly out of scope of the plugin as well, this is what nick plugins are about. On top of that, it's a pain requiring a ton of different packets which change their structure every version and with how many versions TAB supports it doesn't sound like fun doing.

## Additional note 4 - F1 view
Using teams causes player nametags to remain visible when using F1 view. This cannot be avoided by the plugin in any way. The only possible solution would be to modify the client.

## Additional note 5 - Transparent players
Minecraft teams have an option to show players in the same team transparent (partially invisible). This requires both players (viewer and target) to be in the same team. As such, this effect is impossible to achieve with TAB, because it puts every player into a different team to properly sort players and give them different prefix/suffix in nametag (and more, such as collision and nametag visibility).

If you want this effect, the only way is to use another plugin that offers this and disable TAB's teams entirely by setting
```
scoreboard-teams:
  enabled: false
```
in config.yml. Keep in mind you'll not be able to use any team features if you do so.

# API
*To get started with the API, see [Developer API](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Developer-API) page.*

To access this feature, you'll need to obtain `NameTagManager` instance. Get it using `TabAPI.getInstance().getNameTagManager()`. If this feature is disabled, the method will return `null`.

## Changing prefix and suffix
To set the values for the respective formatting, use the following:
* `NameTagManager#setPrefix(TabPlayer, String)`
* `NameTagManager#setSuffix(TabPlayer, String)`
  To reset them, set values to `null`.

To get custom values previously set using the API (they will return `null` if no custom value is set):
* `NameTagManager#getCustomPrefix(TabPlayer)`
* `NameTagManager#getCustomSuffix(TabPlayer)`

To get original value set by the plugin based on configuration:
* `NameTagManager#getOriginalPrefix(TabPlayer)`
* `NameTagManager#getOriginalSuffix(TabPlayer)`

**Note**: These values are only temporary, meaning they won't get saved anywhere and will get reset on player quit or plugin reload. If you wish to save these values into file, use [commands](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Commands-&-Permissions#tab-playergroupplayeruuid-name-property-value-options).

## Collision
* `NameTagManager#getCollisionRule(TabPlayer)` - Returns forced collision rule using the API, `null` if no value was forced and player follows the configuration.
* `NameTagManager#setCollisionRule(TabPlayer, Boolean)` - Forces collision rule to the player. Use `null` to reset value and make it follow configuration again.

## Manipulating visibility
* `NameTagManager#hideNametag(TabPlayer)` - Hides player's nametag from all players
* `NameTagManager#hideNametag(TabPlayer, TabPlayer)` - Hides player's nametag from a specific player, where the first `TabPlayer` is the player who's nametag you want to hide, and the second `TabPlayer` is the player who you want to hide the first player's nametag from.
* `NameTagManager#showNametag(TabPlayer)` - Shows player's nametag back again for everyone
* `NameTagManager#showNametag(TabPlayer, TabPlayer)` - Shows player's nametag back. The first `TabPlayer` is the player who's nametag you want to show, and the second `TabPlayer` is the player who you want to show the first player's nametag to.
* `NameTagManager#hasHiddenNametag(TabPlayer)` - Returns `true` if player has hidden nametag for everyone, `false` if not
* `NameTagManager#hasHiddenNametag(TabPlayer, TabPlayer)` - Returns `true` if player has hidden anmetag for specific player, `false` if not. The first `TabPlayer` is the player who's nametag you want to check is hidden, and the second `TabPlayer` is the player who you want to check if they can see the first player's nametag.

## Disabling team handling
* `NameTagManager#pauseTeamHandling(TabPlayer)` - Pauses team handling for a specific player. This will unregister the player's team and disable anti-override for teams.
* `NameTagManager#resumeTeamHandling(TabPlayer)` - Resumes team handling for a specific player. This will register the player's team and enable anti-override for teams.
* `NameTagManager#hasTeamHandlingPaused(TabPlayer)` - Returns `true` if handling is disabled using methods above, `false` if not.
