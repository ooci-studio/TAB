# About
This page explains how to import TAB's API into your project and together with other pages everything you can do with it.

Before starting please seriously reconsider if you really need this and cannot already achieve it using existing features (such as registering placeholders into PlaceholderAPI instead of TAB, using display conditions for scoreboards, ...). If not, consider making a request.

# Adding the dependency

For Maven users, you can add the API dependency like this:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.NEZNAMY</groupId>
        <artifactId>TAB-API</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
 ```

Or, for Gradle users, here are a few examples:

Groovy:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly 'com.github.NEZNAMY:TAB-API:5.2.0'
}
```

Kotlin:
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://jitpack.io")
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.github.NEZNAMY", "TAB-API", "5.2.0")
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT SHADE THE API IN TO YOUR JAR! DO NOT RELOCATE THE API FROM ITS ORIGINAL PACKAGE!**
> If you relocate, the API that you are calling will also get relocated in your code, meaning that you will be trying to call the relocated API. If you shade the API in, your code could load that bundled API, causing class path conflicts.
Ensure that you are using **`<scope>provided</scope>` for Maven**, or **`compileOnly` for Gradle**.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are on Paper and your plugin is defined as a paper plugin (paper-plugin.yml), TAB's classes may not be visible to the class loader that loaded your plugin. To avoid this issue, do not use paper-plugin.yml in your plugin, just plugin.yml.

# Getting started
First, you need to get an instance of the API.
You can do this with `TabAPI.getInstance()`.  
The `TabAPI` class that you want to import is located in the `me.neznamy.tab.api` package.
If you do not see this imported,
or it is imported but the package is not `me.neznamy.tab.api`, then you have the **wrong class**.

Now you have the instance, you can get a `TabPlayer` with the methods `getPlayer(UUID)` and `getPlayer(String)`, to get players by UUID and name respectively.  
If no player was found with the UUID or the name that you gave, these methods will return `null`. It is important that you catch this, to avoid running in to a `NullPointerException`. You should **NOT** assume that just because a player has logged in that TAB will already have a player for them, as players are processed asynchronously. This will be especially true for join events like `PlayerJoinEvent`.

If you want to be 100% sure that the player you want is loaded when you want to process them, use `PlayerLoadEvent`.
This will give you the `TabPlayer` that has been loaded, so that you can process that `TabPlayer`.
See below for more details on how to use the event.

# Lifespan of API calls
All API calls result in temporary changes to the plugin's logic.
When the plugin is reloaded or server restarted, all previous API calls will lose effect.
This also applies for players after they reconnectâ€”they are reset back.
If you want to perform long-term changes to player's prefix or suffix,
call TAB's [commands](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Commands-&-Permissions) from your plugin.  
If you want to re-apply your changes on plugin reload, listen to [events](#events) using plugin's own event system,
specifically `TabLoadEvent`, which is called on plugin reload.

# Events
TAB is using a custom platform-independent event API. As such, the same event listener code will work on all supported platforms. Usage is also different, let's take a look at an example:
```
TabAPI.getInstance().getEventBus().register(PlayerLoadEvent.class, event -> {
    TabPlayer tabPlayer = event.getPlayer();
    //do something
});
```
TAB plugin provides the following events:
* `TabLoadEvent` - Called when the plugin has finished its load, either on startup or plugin reload.
* `PlayerLoadEvent` - Called when the plugin has finished loading a player (either join or plugin reload).
* `PlaceholderRegisterEvent` - Called when the plugin is about to register a parser for used PlaceholderAPI placeholder, allowing to override it.
