# About
This is a backup of the wiki in case anything happened to the repository, so the wiki will not get lost forever. 
The "Clone this wiki locally" option on GitHub wiki does not actually work (the downloaded file is malformed) and cannot be used to import data from the file (?).
Since GitHub wiki does not support reading the wiki from source code, every change
to the wiki must be copied here as well. The wiki is being updated on an almost daily basis for many reasons, including, but not limited to 
updating compatibility page (especially when new MC versions come out), adding more examples, improving descriptions, fixing mistakes or 
adding information that was previously missing. This synchronization will be done periodically once a month.

# Hyperlinks
All hyperlinks used inside the wiki link to other wiki pages using full URLs. As a result, they will all be broken when browsing here.
This is expected and will not be resolved.
