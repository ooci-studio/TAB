# About
This features gives you control over Minecraft's scoreboard objective feature with BELOW_NAME slot.
This line is displayed below the nametags of all player entities in game. It is not possible to explicitly disable this feature for NPCs, however, this goal can be achieved (see below for more info).
It is only visible when within an 8-block range of the player (the range is hardcoded in the client and cannot be changed with a plugin).

Example visual effect:  
![](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/YlGPCRDJVeZZI0TPWmVBKyHszxSkjatmclyqUThvTz8/https/image.prntscr.com/image/jcETUzVQQYqectQ2aI4iqQ.png)

The feature can be configured in **config.yml** under **belowname-objective** section.  
This is how the default configuration looks:
```
belowname-objective:
  enabled: false
  value: "%health%"
  title: "&cHealth"
  fancy-value: "&c%health%"
  fancy-value-default: "NPC"
  disable-condition: '%world%=disabledworld'
```

The displayed line is not one continuous configurable text. It consists of 2 parts (score and title) joined with a space.  
The exact format is `[score]` + space + `title` (no, the space cannot be removed), where `[score]` is:
* `value` for 1.20.2- (will show `0` on NPCs), which only supports numbers
* `fancy-value` for 1.20.3+ (will show `fancy-value-default` on NPCs), which supports any text

As you can see, the feature still has limits, even on 1.20.3+. If you are below this version or still don't like the forced space, you are out of luck and cannot use this feature the way you would like to. If you have seen this feature seemingly limitless, it could be a feature that was a part of TAB, but removed later. This feature hid the original nametag and placed invisible armor stands instead. If you are interested in this kind of solution, you'll need to look into other plugins.

# Additional Info
## Additional note 1 - Copying nametag visibility rule
The minecraft feature is programmed to be affected by nametag visibility rule.
This means that when the nametag is set to invisible, belowname will be invisible as well.

## Additional note 2 - Hidden on sneak on 1.8
Belowname is not visible on 1.8.x clients when player is sneaking. This is client-sided behavior and cannot be changed by the server.

## Additional note 3 - Visible on NPCs
Belowname objective is automatically attached to all entities of player type with the default value of
`0` (<1.20.3) or value configured as `fancy-value-default` (1.20.3+).
This includes player NPCs.

There is currently only one way to make them not visible on NPCs.
From [Additional note 1 - Copying nametag visibility rule](#additional-note-1---copying-nametag-visibility-rule) we know
that belowname is not visible if player's nametag is invisible.
NPC plugin can take advantage of this by using teams to hide the original name and display a hologram instead.

This is how you can achieve it using the following popular NPC plugins:
* **Citizens**:
  * 1 - Select the NPC (`/npc select <ID>` or `/npc select` to select the nearest NPC)
  * 2 - Hide its original nametag (which also hides belowname) using `/npc name`
  * 3 - Display your desired text using `/npc hologram add <text>` ([more info](https://wiki.citizensnpcs.co/Commands#:~:text=the%20NPC%20hitbox-,/npc%20hologram,-add%20%5Btext%5D%20%7C%20set))

# Additional note 4 - Compatibility with modified clients
Sadly, this feature is suffering from bugs introduced by third party clients such as Feather and Lunar. These two completely ignore `fancy-value` as if it was never added into the game, even on 1.20.3+. This is just an example, and it's not limited to these two clients and this one issue. If you experience issues with the feature and believe you configured it correctly, use vanilla client to make sure it's not caused by a broken client.

# Compatibility with other plugins
TAB does not contain any sort of compatibility functionality for this feature. 
It will not try to prevent other plugins from applying the feature and neither will it detect it to re-add back once the other plugin removes it. 
Therefore, if another plugin also sends belowname objective, TAB's may not show anymore (depending on who sends it first). 
Make sure you do not have any other plugin sending it to ensure the feature works properly.

# Limitations
* [1.5 - 1.12.2] Title length is limited to 32 characters (including color codes).
* [1.5 - 1.20.2] `value` is limited to a white number.
* [Bedrock] Doesn't support 1.20.3+ features (`fancy-value`), `value` will be displayed instead, just like on <1.20.3
* The format is a **[score] + space + shared title**. No, the space cannot be removed.
* The title is the same on all players, therefore, it cannot be personalized (such as player's faction). Only [score] can be per-player.
* It appears on all entities of player type. **This includes player NPCs.**

# Examples
## Example 1 - Per-world values
This feature doesn't directly support per-world values or similar.
However, this can be achieved with conditions.
Let's make `fancy-value` conditional based on player's world.
Let's make an example with 3 worlds.
Check if player is in world `world1`, then show one text.
If not, check if player is in world `world2`, then show another text.
If not, show the final text.
This can be achieved by chaining 2 conditions:
```
conditions:
  belowname1:
    conditions:
    - "%world%=world1"
    true: "Text to display in world world1" # Player is in world world1, display the text
    false: "%condition:belowname2%" # Player is not in world world1, check another condition
  belowname2:
    conditions:
    - "%world%=world2"
    true: "Text to display in world world2" # Player is in world world2, display the text
    false: "Text to display in other worlds" # Player is not in any of the 2 worlds
```
> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT JUST RANDOMLY PASTE THIS ENTIRE "CONDITIONS" SECTION INTO YOUR CONFIG!
> INSTEAD, EDIT YOUR EXISTING CONDITIONS SECTION TO PREVENT HAVING THE SECTION TWICE,
> HAVING SECOND ONE COMPLETELY OVERRIDE THE FIRST ONE!

Finally, use this condition as value in `fancy-value`:
```
belowname-objective:
  fancy-value: "%condition:belowname1%"
```
If you are under 1.20.3 and want to make `value` and `title` conditional,
create two condition chains, one for each value and use them.

> [!NOTE]
> This is just an example, the plugin is not limited to displaying different values only per world.
> If you want per server values on BungeeCord, use %server% with server names.
> If you want WorldGuard regions, use %worldguard_region_name% with region names.
> This works for any placeholder offered by the plugin or by PlaceholderAPI.

## Example 2 - Hiding `title` for 1.20.3+ players
1.20.3 has replaced `value` field,
which is limited to a white number with value configurable as `fancy-value`, which has no limits.
However, `title` field is still visible on 1.20.3+.
If you support both version ranges and want to make the best out of the new functionality,
you might want to not show `title` to 1.20.3+ players anymore,
since you can fully customize the text you want to display in `fancy-value`.

First, let's remind ourselves what `title` *actually* is.
It is actually called scoreboard title.
Yes, just like the one on top of sidebar, just displayed elsewhere.
This is why it displays on all players and placeholders are parsed for the viewing player.
With this knowledge, all we need to do is check for player's version and only show something for <1.20.3.
For this, we will use `%player-version-id%` placeholder,
which returns the network protocol version of player's game version, which can then be compared to.
```
conditions:
  version:
    - "%player-version-id%>=765" # 1.20.3 is 765
  true: "" # Show empty value for 1.20.3+
  false: "Some text to display"
```
> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT JUST RANDOMLY PASTE THIS ENTIRE "CONDITIONS" SECTION INTO YOUR CONFIG!
> INSTEAD, EDIT YOUR EXISTING CONDITIONS SECTION TO PREVENT HAVING THE SECTION TWICE,
> HAVING SECOND ONE COMPLETELY OVERRIDE THE FIRST ONE!
```
belowname-objective:
  title: "%condition:version%"
```
Unfortunately, due to the limitations of this feature,
there is a forced space between `value`/`fancy-value` and `title`,
even if the `title` is empty.
You'll either need to live with it, or put some shared text there to avoid having a space at the end.

## Example 3 - Displaying health as 0-10 or in %
If you want health to display health as 0-10 instead of 0-20, you can achieve it with PlaceholderAPI:
* `%math_0_{player_health}/2%` for 0-10
* `%math_0_{player_health}*5%` for 0-100
  In order to use these placeholders, make sure PlaceholderAPI is installed and its `math` and `player` expansions are downloaded.

# Tips & Tricks
## Tip 1 - Heart symbol
If you want to show health of players and display a heart symbol instead of text saying "Health", you can use this one: `❤`.
```
belowname-objective:
  title: "&4❤"
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure your config is [saved in UTF-8 encoding](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/How-to-save-the-config-in-UTF8-encoding) to properly read the heart symbol.

# Example 4 - Health bar using hearts
You can achieve this on `1.20.3+` using `healthbar` expansion from PlaceholderAPI:
```
belowname-objective:
  fancy-value: "%healthbar_healthbar%"
```

Sadly, there is no way to remove the forced space between `fancy-value` and `title`. You can only try to play around it by adding some static text after it, to make it look like the space is intended. Or you can just ignore the space and live with it.
