When a plugin for linking proxies is detected, TAB automatically enables its hook to add support for it.
No configuration is necessary.  
Supported redis plugins:
* [RedisBungee](https://github.com/ProxioDev/RedisBungee)

Supported features:
* [Belowname](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Belowname)
* [Global playerlist](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Global-playerlist)
* [Nametags](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Nametags) & [Sorting](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Sorting-players-in-tablist)
* [Tablist name formatting](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Tablist-name-formatting)
* [Playerlist Objective](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Playerlist-Objective)

The hook does not and will never support [Layout](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Layout), which would require drastic changes to the feature itself and wouldn't be worth it, since the amount of visible players is usually even lower due to fixed slots and RedisBungee is used on networks with many players, so there will be enough players to work with anyway.
