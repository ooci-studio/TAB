## Easy to install
Support for all possible Minecraft versions containing features the plugin is able to take advantage of.
Support for multiple platforms (Bukkit, BungeeCord, Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, Sponge, Velocity),
with everything contained in a single jar which you can download directly.
No need to browse version history, ask what plugin version you need for your server version,
visit random websites looking for the download button, or anything similar.
The same jar supports all versions & platforms, and the latest plugin version will always work for you.

## It works
The plugin doesn't spam your console with errors, doesn't have compatibility issues with half of the plugins,
and doesn't just decide to randomly stop working for no reason.
It just works.
Bug reports are fixed with the highest priority and preferred over adding new features.
It's not unusual for a plugin of this size to have a 3-digit open issue count on GitHub.
Meanwhile, TAB is always at 1-digit count.

## Feature packed
All the most requested features in a single plugin.
No need to install many plugins, disable features, so they don't conflict with each other,
or be forced to run your server on a version that all the plugins support in common.
All features, all server versions in a single plugin.

## Up to date
The plugin is not abandoned.
It is constantly getting updated to fix reported bugs,
add support for new MC versions as they come out and get new optimizations.
All that can help it run as smoothly as possible, whilst still working the way you want it to.

## High performance
Unlike with other plugins where "high performance"
often means your CPU usage will be high, TAB has a very low CPU footprint.
There is a [command](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Commands-&-Permissions#tab-cpu) available
that shows the entire plugin's CPU usage.
Here you can see which part of TAB is occupying the most of your CPU.
There are [many ways to optimize TAB](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Optimizing-the-plugin)
to get the most out of it.
Performance is also actively monitored on large servers, and observations show that it performs very well,
meaning it will almost certainly perform even better on smaller servers.

## Simple yet powerful configuration
Compared to other plugins, each feature is easier to configure and actually offers more.
