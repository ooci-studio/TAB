# About
This folder contains the plugin's description as advertised on various marketplaces which use various syntax's (bbcode, markdown).  
  
While this is not accurate folder to have this stored in (".github"), it is the closest if we don't want to create a folder for this in the root.  
  
The file structure of this folder is as following:  

| File name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
