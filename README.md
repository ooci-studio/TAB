### Dev builds
Plugin's development is continuous and contains lots of small changes/fixes not worthy of being called a full
update, therefore development builds are being created and eventually a full update is released when enough changes are made.  
If you want to benefit from a recent change in the code before official release, you can download development builds
from [GitHub actions](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/actions) (you must be logged into GitHub to be able to download it).
